# Reading Journal for Japanese Learners
### Track Books in Japanese & English

A simple reading tracker designed for Japanese learners who want to keep Japanese and English book information separately.

This project is also a personal experiment in digital marketing and user experience. I use it to test ideas, improve usability, and document the process.
